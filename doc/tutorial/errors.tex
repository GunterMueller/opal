\chapter{Common Errors and What To Do}
\label{chap:errors}

This appendix will describe some common programming errors and how
to avoid them. 
The collection is incomplete as  we are still looking for new
errors.
If you have found a typical programming error and you think it should
be included here, we would encourage you to send this error (together
with the solution) to the author (email: jue@cs.tu-berlin.de).

\begin{errorlist}
\error{Expected was FI ... instead of OTHERWISE}{Behind an \pro{OTHERWISE}
  there must be another guard; no immediate object declaration (\pro{LET
  ...}) is allowed.}

\error{Expected was IN ... instead of IF}{\pro{IF}-expressions within
  other expressions have to be enclosed in parantheses.}

\error{Missing Operand}{Missing delimiter (e.g.~space) between
  graphical symbols; Example: \pro{a::b::c::<>} must be written as
  \pro{a::b::c:: <>}}

\error{Undefined identification}{Typically wrong typing: missing
  import of the operation, import with the wrong functionality (in
  cases of overloaded functions), wrong functionality in declaration.}

\error{Undefined identification}{Function application in prefix
  notation without paranthesss, compiler will assume postfix notation:
  \pro{\% c} must be written as \pro{\%(c)}}
  
\end{errorlist}

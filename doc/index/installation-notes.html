<h3>Notes on installing OCS/OASYS</h3>

This is a binary distribution of the OPAL Compilation System which
should run `out-of-the-box' on Linux 2/Intel and Solaris 2.5/Sparc.
(On solaris, the GNU C compiler and GNU make program must be
available).<p>

<UL>
<LI>
Move the root directory of the distribution to a place of your choice
(e.g. <code>/usr/ocs</code> or <code>/usr/local/ocs</code>). Do
<emph>not</emph> use <code>cp</code> for this purpose; if you
need to move across file-system boundaries, use <code>tar</code>
(or unpack the distribution again in the other file system).<p>

<blockquote><small> <b>Note</b>: on Solaris, it is currently necessary
to use either <code>/usr/local/ocs</code> or <code>/usr/ocs</code> as
the installation place (at least, a symbolic link from there to the
installation place must exist). Otherwise, it will become necessary to
define <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> to point to
<em>ocs</em><code>/lib/sol2-sparc</code> for running applications
which are linked against Opal libraries which do indirectly base on
other ones in the distribution (currently only <code>OPAL_WIN</code>
and <code>OPAL_READLINE</code>).  </small></blockquote>


<LI>
Extend the search path to include the directory
<code>/usr/ocs/bin</code>. Afterwards, the command <code>ocs
info</code> should yield

<pre>
    $ ocs info
->  You are using `ocs-2.3a'
->  located at `/usr/ocs'.
->  The project ($OCSPROJECT) is not specified.
</pre>

Note that it's not possible to call <code>ocs</code> with an
explicite absolute path; it must be found via the search path.<p>

<LI> 
Try to compile and run some of the examples. The mini-tutorial
gives guidance for doing so. On troubles, read the further notes
below. If the troubles can't be fixed, don't hesitate to contact
us.<p>

<LI>
If you want to use the Emacs/XEmacs mode, look at the instructions
in <code>/usr/ocs/lib/emacs/README.emacs</code>.

</UL>


<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

There are two likely sources of troubles on the way of getting this
distribution to work:

<UL>
<LI>
<b>Unix commands are not found</b><p>

OCS depends on a large amount of Unix commands, which are listed
together with their absolute locations in
<code>/usr/ocs/lib/om/specs/Specs.basic</code>.  We have tried to use
canonical pathes - whatever canonical means under Unix systems. The
reference installation for the Linux version was Redhat 4.2 and for
the Sparc version Solaris 2.5 (SunOS 5.5). <p>

Typically, on Solaris the GNU tools (gcc and gmake) may be installed
at different places as defined in <code>Specs.basic</code>.  <p>

If <code>Specs.basic</code> is changed, you need to make
the changes manually also to <code>ShSpecs.basic</code>, or
to run
<pre>
  /usr/ocs/lib/om/etc/gmake2h < Specs.basic > ShSpecs.basic # sh
</pre>

<LI>
<b>Shared libraries are not found</b><p>

This should not happen on Solaris systems, since the code of non-standard
features (such as Tcl/Tk and Readline) is included in the
distribution.  On Linux, it is expected that -lreadline, -ltcl, and
-ltk are available as shared objects in the standard run path.

Use <code>ldd</code> (<code>ldd -s</code> on Solaris) to analyze, and
perhaps <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> or <code>ldconfig</code> to fix
problems with shared libraries.</p>

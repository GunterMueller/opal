# Opal - Optimized Applicative Language

Opal is a strict, purely functional programming language that combines ideas from algebraic specification and applicative programming. It has been developed by the Compiler Construction and Programming Languages group at the Technische Universit√§t Berlin headed by Prof. Dr. Peter Pepper from 1985 to 2000. The maintenance of Opal has been discontinued in 2015.

To use reflections in Opal, you must do the following: First, make
sure that OPAL_LIBS contains $(OC_REFLECTIONS) and second, make sure
that the InterOpal filter dynamite is called between the Opal
compiler's front and back end.

This is most easily achieved, if you use the file ProjectDefs.dynamite
in this directory.

	bash> export OCSPROJECT=`pwd`/ProjectDefs.reflections

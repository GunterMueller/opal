The examples in this section are intended to demonstrate the power and ease
of use of reflections. That means, that the following examples are not
necessarily impossible to program without reflections -- it is simply much
easier or more convenient to use reflections.
                  
The first example, a pretty printer, is a typical example of the
employment of reflections often found in the literature. It shows how to use
a reflection to decide how to print a value.

The second example is a simple game where you must guess a secret
number. This example is used to demonstrate the use of @code{IStream} and
@code{OStream}.

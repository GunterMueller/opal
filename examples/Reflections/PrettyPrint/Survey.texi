This is an implementation of a pretty printer which takes an arbitrary
value, packed as a reflection, and then prints it in a human readable
way. 

This program is the basic "Hello Reflection World" program found in the
literature, build on top of our reflection mechanism. Note, that a much
refined version of the pretty printer is given by the free type stream
library.

"Guesses" is very simple game known to everybody: One player (in our
case the computer) picks a secret number. The other player must try to
guess this number and the first player must say whether the guess was
too low or too high. The game ends, when the second player has guessed
the number.

The main idea behind this example is to present a little more involved
program which employs the free type stream library.

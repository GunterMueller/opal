In order to execute a function that is stored on disk (i.e. by ../Dump/dump),
its object code is searched in the path given by OCS_DL_PATH.

Currently, however, also the variables NMU and DLD must be defined manually. 
The setting of this variables must be determined by consulting one of the 
files .../lib/om/specs/Specs.basic or .../lib/om/specs/ShSpecs.basic. 

Typically the environment is set up as follows (bash):

> export OCS_DL_PATH=../Dump/OCS
> export NMU="nm -u -h"
> export DLD="gcc -shared"

The example is compiled and executed as follows:
(../Dump/dump.data must have been previously created by ../Dump/dump) 

> ocs -top Exec exec 
> ./exec ../Dump/dump.data

Multiple directories in OCS_DL_PATH must be separated by colons. 

(This example also assumes that the basic Opal library is installed 
as "shared library".)

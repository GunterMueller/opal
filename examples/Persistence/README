This examples demonstrates how a function (like any other Opal type) 
can be stored on disk. Later on this function can be loaded from disk. 
Execution of the loaded function requires dynamic linking. 

The subdirectory Dump contains a program to store a function.
The subdirectory Exec contains a program to load and execute a function.

The path to the object code of a dynamically loaded function must be 
given by the environment OCS_DL_PATH.

> cd Dump
> ocs                               # ocs -top Dump dump
> ./dump                            # creates dump.data
> cd ../Exec
> ocs                               # ocs -top Exec exec
> export OCS_DL_PATH=../Dump/OCS    # bash environment
> ./exec ../Dump/dump.data

Dynamic linking will only work if the system supports dlopen(). 
For further information see Exec/README.

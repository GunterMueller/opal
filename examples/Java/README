This directory contains examples regarding the `javabind' tool
(ALPHA stuff).

Javabind is a Java (actually Pizza) program which generates bindings
of Java classes for Opal. A JDK which supports the JNI is required
to use javabind. (Currently only tested for JDK 1.1.4). For more
information, see the online documentation of Bibliotheca Opalica,
subsystem Tools/Java.

To run the examples, do the following (but also see remark below):

1. In the current directory, execute

	javabind examples.jb

   This will create a directory ./JavaLib, containing bindings
   as specified by examples.jb.

2. Change to ./JavaLib and run ocs. This will compile the bindings
   generated in the previous step.

3. Change to ./HelloWorld or ./GetURL, and run ocs. These are two examples
   using bounded functionality of Java 1.1. GetURL is a cool one 
   (retrieving, in OPAL, through Java, the contents of any URL on the net).

4. For execution make sure that your CLASSPATH is set up properly!
   (e.g. export CLASSPATH=~uebb/java/jdk/lib/classes.zip)

Remark: at the time of this writing, to link with Java it is necessary to 
have, beside OPAL_LIBS = $(OPAL_JAVA) $(OPAL_BASE), an $(OCSPROJECT) 
with the following definitions:

	include ${OCSOM}/specs/Specs.lib.opal_java
	CLDLIBS += ${JAVALINK}
	CINCPATH += ${JAVAINCLUDE}

This directory contains examples regarding the `javabind' tool
(ALPHA stuff).

Javabind is a Java (actually Pizza) program which generates Opal
bindings for arbitrary Java code.  A JDK which supports the JNI is required
to use javabind. (Currently only tested for JDK 1.1.7). For more
information, see the online documentation of Bibliotheca Opalica,
subsystem Tools/Java.

To run the examples, do the following (but see also remark below):

1. In the current directory, execute

	javabind examples.jb

   This will create a directory ./JavaLib, containing bindings
   as specified by examples.jb.

2. Change to ./JavaLib and run ocs. This will compile the bindings
   generated in the previous step.

3. Change to ./HelloWorld or ./GetURL, and run ocs. These are two examples
   using functionality of Java 1.1. GetURL is a cool one 

4. For execution make sure that your CLASSPATH is set up properly!
   (e.g. export CLASSPATH=$JDKHOME/lib/classes.zip)

Remark: at the time of this writing, to compile and link with 
Java it is necessary to have an ${OCSPROJECT} with the following 
definitions:

	include ${OCSOM}/specs/Specs.lib.opal_java
	CLDLIBS += ${JAVALINK}
	CINCPATH += ${JAVAINCLUDE}

You may use the ProjectDefs.Java found in this directory:

	bash> export OCSPROJECT=`pwd`/ProjectDefs.Java

/* %DOSFOP is able to generate an index that administers the locations of all
function applications that occur in the whole project. The InterOpal internal
database provides all necessary informations to assemble the information we
need. This structure is provides the basis for a application index map that is
generated for each individual implementation module that is member of the 
documented project. During translation the mapping is used to generate
index references that are gather by the @TeX{}-translation process later on. */

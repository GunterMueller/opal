This is a syntax file for the vim (vi improved) text editor. 
(See http://www.vim.org for details)

Until opal is a language supported by the regular vim-distribution, you
habe three possibilities to use the opal-syntax file:

(1) Source the file in command-mode

(2) Source the file by hitting a shortcut, defined in your personal 
vimrc file (preferred method)

(3) Change the vim-distri to make vim recognize opal files from their 
ending (must have write permisson for the root vim-distribution
directory (often /usr/share/vim))

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Source the file in command-mode:
Enter the following command in command-line mode

:source OPALPATH/opal.vim

Important: Replace OPALVIMPATH with the complete path to the opal.vim file
(typically /usr/local/ocs/lib/vim). Opal code should now be hightlighted.



(2) Source the file by hitting a shorcut:
Copy the following two lines to your ~/.vimrc file 

" F10 calls the Opal Syntax File 
nmap <F10> :source OPALVIMPATH/opal.vim <CR>


Again replace OPALVIMPATH with the complete path to the opal.vim file.
You can also replace the "F10" key with any key you like, for example
"F1", "F2", "Help" (on Sun Type 5) and so on. Hitting key "F10" in 
normal-mode will then syntax-highlight the opal file. 




(3) Change the vim-distri:
Edit the file $VIM/filetype.vim in the vim-distri-tree and add the 
two lines

" Opal
au BufNewFile,BufRead *.sign,*.impl    set ft=opal

to filetype specifications part (I dont know if alphabetical
order matters), copy the opal syntax file in the $VIM/syntax directory
and hit the command ":sy on" in command-line mode (or in your vimrc file).
Opal syntax ist now known to files ending with sign or impl

opal-mode v2


- works now with FSF Emacs and XEmacs

- uses submenus to group former Dosfop, Browser, Compile, Opalfile menus

- new menus Switch and Import

- Switch menu also available via Alt - left mouse button

- Import menu also available via Alt - middle mouse button

- Import structures and items works with completion. The necessary maps are 
	kept in a file and associated buffer. Name of this file is 
	opal-alist-file (default ~/.opal-alists); use defvar before loading 
	opal-mode to change the name or to set this variable to nil and thus 
	inhibit saving.

	(defvar opal-diag-extended-flag nil) to start with extended help off.

- Diag mode offers help in inserting missing items

- New opal-defs-mode for ProjectDefs and SysDefs files.

/* % The command @code{dynamite} expects the name of an interopal
     file as its first command line argument. It reads the file and,
     if it contains the implementation part of a structure,
     transforms the interopal code, enabling dynamic structure
     parameters. When invoked on other parts (i.e. signature or
     properties), it does nothing. */

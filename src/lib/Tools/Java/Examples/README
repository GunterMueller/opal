To run the examples:

- let the environment variable OCSPROJECT point to the file
  ./ProjectDefs.java (or include the contents of ./ProjectDefs.java
  in your own OCSPROJECT)

- in the current directory, execute

	javabind examples.jb

  This should create some bindings for Java facilities used by
  the examples, in ./JavaLib.

- change to directory ./JavaLib and run ocs to compile the bindings

- the directories ./HelloWorld und ./GetURL contain the 
  programs; compile them with ocs as usually
